# FlappyLuaGame

This project is a small game created for self-education and to practice my Lua programming skills. It is built using the LÃ–VE 2D game framework.

The initial version of this game is based on the "Bird" tutorial from Simple Game Tutorials, which can be found here: https://berbasoft.com/simplegametutorials/love/bird/
